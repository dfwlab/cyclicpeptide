Topological Polar Surface Area,"Measures the surface area occupied by polar atoms, often used to predict drug transport properties."
Complexity,"Indicates the structural complexity of the molecule, with higher values representing more intricate structures."
Crippen Log(P),"Represents the logarithm of the partition coefficient between n-octanol and water, used to estimate the molecule's hydrophobicity."
Heavy Atom Count,"Counts the number of non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule, reflecting its size and complexity."
Hydrogen Bond Donor Count,"The number of atoms in the molecule that can donate hydrogen bonds, important for molecular interactions."
Hydrogen Bond Acceptor Count,"The number of atoms capable of accepting hydrogen bonds, crucial for molecular recognition and binding."
Rotatable Bond Count,"Counts the number of bonds that allow free rotation around themselves, affecting the molecule's flexibility."
Formal Charge,"The overall electric charge of the molecule, with zero indicating a neutral molecule."
Refractivity,"Measures the molecule's ability to refract light, related to polarizability and electronic properties."
RDKit Fingerprint,This is an RDKit-specific fingerprint.
Daylight-like Fingerprint,This is an RDKit-specific fingerprint that is inspired by (though it differs significantly from) public descriptions of the Daylight fingerprint.
Morgan Fingerprint,"The RDKit implementation uses the feature types Donor, Acceptor, Aromatic, Halogen, Basic, and Acidic."
MACCS Keys,SMARTS definitions for the publicly available MACCS keys and a MACCS fingerprinter.
